Bitcoin Quantum Information Science

First project --> Model Bitcoin's supply equation;  \sum_{i=0}^{32} 210000 * \frac{50}{2^{i}} (LaTex MarkUp) using a quantum computer with 5 qubits

Second Project --> Build a simple quantum communication protocol for sending Bitcoin keys (private or public) from one person to another across a quantum secure channel e.g. quantum satellites.
