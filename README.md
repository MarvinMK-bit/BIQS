Bitcoin Quantum Information Science

1. First project --> Model Bitcoin's supply equation;  \sum_{i=0}^{32} 210000 * \frac{50}{2^{i}} (LaTex MarkUp) using a quantum computer with 5 qubits

2. Second Project --> Build a simple quantum communication protocol for sending Bitcoin keys (private or public) from one person to another across a quantum secure channel e.g. quantum satellites.

3. Third Project --> Analyzing Bitcoin blockchain data scraped from mempool.space using a Quantum Computer. Crash Task was to plot a history of 8 consecutive block fees using 3 qubits.

4. Fourth Project -- Encding Bitcoin's ASCII text logo using the Qiskit SDK (a quantum computer simulator)
